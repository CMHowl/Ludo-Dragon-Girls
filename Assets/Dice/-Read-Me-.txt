!!IMPORTANT!! - Set you project gravity to [-60] for the best rolling physics simulation behaviour
[Menu] Edit->Project Settings->Physics


USAGE

Under [Project] Dice->Resources->Prefabs , you will find the full scripted and textured dice prefabs that you
can use in your project. The prefabs already have collider and rigid body components.

If you would want to change physics behaviour you could alter the physics material that all dice use. This physics material can be found at [Project] Dice->Materials->general = 'dice-material'

Each prefab has a Class Die (subclassed) script that contains a 'value' attribute that displays the 'side-up' value at all times.

Under [Project] Dice->Plugins, you find a Dice.cs script file that holds some static 'helper' methods that you can use to roll dice and calculate or display the values.

Under [Project] Dice->Scenes->Demo you will find the demo scene that makes use of the static helper functions.

All c# code in this project has 'inline' code documentation.
